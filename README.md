Explanation:

1. Receipt Class: The Receipt class now stores multiple events for a user, along with the total fee. The add_event method adds event details to the receipt.

2. EventManager Class: The register_for_event method now adds each event's details to the user's receipt using the Receipt class.

3. Main Function:

Users can register for multiple events in a loop.
The receipt is displayed at the end, after the user chooses to finish the registration process.


How it Works:

1. View Events: The user can view a list of events with their fees and addresses.

2. Register for Events: The user can register for multiple events as either a participant or an audience member.

3. Generate Consolidated Receipt: After all registrations, the user can get a single receipt that lists all the events they registered for, their roles, the fee for each event, and a total fee.

4. This project is built using python , with oops concept integrated for the event management application.
